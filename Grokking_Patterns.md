#### Introduction to Custom Data Structures
Custom data structures involve designing and implementing specialized data structures to solve specific problems efficiently. These structures are often used when built-in data structures do not meet the performance requirements.

---

#### [Snapshot Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/snapshot-array/)
Implement a SnapshotArray that supports taking a snapshot of an array and retrieving the value of the array at a given index for a specific snapshot.

---

#### [Time-Based Key-Value Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/)
Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a specific time.

---

#### [Implement LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)
Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.

---

#### [Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/)
Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time: insert, delete, and getRandom.

---

#### [Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

---

#### [LFU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/)
Design and implement a data structure for Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.

### 33. Pattern: Bitwise Manipulation

#### Introduction to Bitwise Manipulation
Bitwise manipulation involves using bitwise operators to perform operations directly on the binary representations of integers. These operations are often more efficient than their arithmetic or logical counterparts.

---

#### [Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)
Given two strings `s` and `t` which consist of only lowercase letters. String `t` is generated by randomly shuffling string `s` and then adding one more letter at a random position. Find the letter that was added in `t`.

---

#### [Complement of Base 10 Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/)
Every non-negative integer `N` has a binary representation. The complement of this binary representation is another binary number where each bit is flipped (0 to 1 and 1 to 0). Return the complement of `N`.

---

#### [Flipping an Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/)
Given a binary matrix, flip the image horizontally, then invert it.

---

#### [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)
Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

---

#### [Two Single Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)
Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

---

#### [Encode and Decode Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/)
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

---

#### [Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)
Reverse the bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
