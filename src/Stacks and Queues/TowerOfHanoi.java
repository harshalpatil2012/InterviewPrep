/*
In the classic problem of Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N diskes of different sizes which can slide onto any tower.
The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom.
You have the following constraints:
(1) Only one disk can be moved at a time
(2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next rod
(3) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk
Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using Stacks.
