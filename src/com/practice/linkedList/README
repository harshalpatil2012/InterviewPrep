=======

1.	Creating a Linked List
	--	class Node
2.	Deleting a node from a singly linked list
3.	runner technique
	--	runner: second pointer
		iterate through the linked list with two pointers simultaneously, with one ahead of the other. The fast one might be ahead by a fixed amount
4.	recursive problem
	--	a number of linked list problems rely on recursion
	--	recursive algorithms takes at least O(N) space, where n is the depth of the recursive call
