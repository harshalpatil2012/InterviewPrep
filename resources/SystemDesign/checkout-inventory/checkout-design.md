Here's a high-level system design for a scalable checkout system for a global ticketing platform like BookMyShow, with a focus on inventory management and scalability. Let's break it down into functional and non-functional requirements, along with the key components of the system.

Title: Scalable Global Ticketing Checkout System with Precise Inventory Management

Functional Requirements:
1. User authentication and authorization
2. Browsing and searching for events
3. Selecting seats or tickets
4. Adding tickets to cart
5. Processing payments
6. Inventory management (prevent overselling/underselling)
7. Order confirmation and ticket delivery

Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Scalability: Handle 100 million users globally
2. High availability: 99.99% uptime
3. Low latency: Response time < 200ms for most operations
4. Consistency: Ensure accurate inventory across all nodes
5. Fault tolerance: System should continue to function in case of partial failures
6. Security: Protect user data and prevent fraud

Key Components:

1. Load Balancer:
    - Distribute incoming traffic across multiple application servers
    - Use geo-based routing to direct users to the nearest data center

2. Application Servers:
    - Stateless servers handling user requests
    - Implement business logic for ticket selection, cart management, etc.

3. Distributed Cache (e.g., Redis):
    - Store frequently accessed data like event details, seat maps
    - Reduce database load and improve response times

4. Inventory Management Service:
    - Maintain real-time inventory counts
    - Use distributed locking mechanism to prevent race conditions
    - Implement optimistic locking for concurrent updates

5. Database Cluster:
    - Primary database for write operations
    - Read replicas for scalability and fault tolerance
    - Sharding based on event ID or location for horizontal scaling

6. Message Queue (e.g., Apache Kafka):
    - Handle asynchronous operations like payment processing and notifications
    - Ensure system resilience and scalability

7. Payment Gateway:
    - Integration with multiple payment providers
    - Implement retry mechanism for failed transactions

8. Notification Service:
    - Send order confirmations and tickets via email/SMS
    - Push notifications for mobile app users

9. CDN (Content Delivery Network):
    - Serve static content like images and event information
    - Reduce latency for users across different geographical locations

10. Monitoring and Logging System:
    - Track system health, performance metrics, and user activities
    - Set up alerts for anomalies and potential issues

To address the specific requirement of preventing inventory oversold/undersold issues:

1. Implement a distributed locking mechanism using a tool like Redis or ZooKeeper to ensure atomic operations on ticket inventory.

2. Use optimistic locking in the database to handle concurrent updates:
    - When reading inventory, store a version number
    - When updating, check if the version number has changed
    - If changed, retry the operation

3. Implement a reservation system:
    - When a user selects a ticket, create a temporary reservation
    - Set a short expiration time (e.g., 10 minutes) for the reservation
    - If the user doesn't complete the purchase, release the reservation

4. Use eventual consistency for displaying available tickets, but enforce strong consistency for actual bookings.

5. Implement a separate inventory reconciliation service that periodically checks and corrects any discrepancies between the displayed and actual inventory.

- POST /api/users/login
- GET /api/users/profile
- PUT /api/users/profile

### Event Management
- GET /api/events
- GET /api/events/{event_id}
- GET /api/events/{event_id}/tickets

### Ticket Management
- POST /api/tickets/reserve
- DELETE /api/tickets/release
- GET /api/tickets/{ticket_id}

### Order Management
- POST /api/orders
- GET /api/orders/{order_id}
- GET /api/users/{user_id}/orders

### Payment Processing
- POST /api/payments
- GET /api/payments/{payment_id}

### Admin APIs
- POST /api/admin/events
- PUT /api/admin/events/{event_id}
- POST /api/admin/venues
- PUT /api/admin/venues/{venue_id}

## Additional Components

1. Caching Layer
    - Implement a multi-level caching strategy
    - Use in-memory cache (e.g., Redis) for hot data
    - Employ a distributed cache (e.g., Memcached) for less frequently accessed data

2. Search Service
    - Implement Elasticsearch for fast and efficient event search
    - Index events based on various criteria (name, venue, date, etc.)

3. Analytics Service
    - Collect and process user behavior data
    - Generate insights for business decisions and personalized recommendations

4. Rate Limiter
    - Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage

5. Authentication and Authorization Service
    - Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
    - Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication

6. Fraud Detection System
    - Implement rules-based and machine learning models to detect suspicious activities
    - Flag potentially fraudulent transactions for review

7. Recommendation Engine
    - Analyze user preferences and behavior
    - Provide personalized event recommendations

8. Backup and Disaster Recovery
    - Implement regular database backups
    - Set up a disaster recovery plan with failover mechanisms

9. CI/CD Pipeline
    - Automate testing, building, and deployment processes
    - Implement blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates

10. API Gateway
    - Centralize API management, including versioning, documentation, and access control
    - Implement request/response transformation and protocol translation if needed

11. Internationalization and Localization Service
    - Support multiple languages and currencies
    - Adapt content based on user's geographical location

12. WebSocket Service
    - Implement real-time updates for ticket availability and live event information

## Additional Considerations for Inventory Management

1. Inventory Reservation Queue
    - Implement a separate queue for ticket reservations
    - Process reservations in order to ensure fairness

2. Inventory Snapshot Service
    - Periodically create snapshots of the inventory state
    - Use snapshots for quick recovery in case of discrepancies

3. Overbooking Strategy
    - Implement a configurable overbooking system for events where it's applicable
    - Carefully manage overbooking to balance between maximizing sales and customer satisfaction

4. Inventory Audit Trail
    - Log all inventory changes with timestamps and associated actions
    - Use this for debugging, reconciliation, and compliance purposes

By implementing these additional components and considerations, the ticketing system will be more robust, scalable, and capable of handling complex scenarios related to inventory management and high-concurrency situations.
