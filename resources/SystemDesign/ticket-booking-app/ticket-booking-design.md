## API Design Considerations

1. **Versioning**: Use versioning in the URL (e.g., `/api/v1/`) to allow for future updates without breaking existing clients.

2. **Authentication**: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Include an `Authorization` header in protected endpoints.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. Include rate limit information in response headers.

4. **Pagination**: Use cursor-based pagination for list endpoints to handle large datasets efficiently.

5. **Error Handling**: Use standard HTTP status codes and return detailed error messages in the response body.

6. **HATEOAS**: Implement HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State) for better discoverability and navigation between resources.

7. **Caching**: Use ETags and Last-Modified headers to enable client-side caching where appropriate.

8. **Compression**: Support gzip compression for responses to reduce bandwidth usage.

9. **CORS**: Implement proper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers to allow access from web clients.

10. **API Documentation**: Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for comprehensive API documentation.

# Ticket Booking System Database Schema

For a global-scale ticket booking system, we'll use a combination of relational and NoSQL databases to handle different types of data and ensure scalability. Here's a proposed schema design:

## Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Events Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    start_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    end_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    venue_id UUID REFERENCES venues(id),
    total_seats INTEGER,
    available_seats INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Venues Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE venues (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT,
    city VARCHAR(100),
    country VARCHAR(100),
    capacity INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Bookings Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
    booking_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Tickets Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE tickets (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id),
    seat_number VARCHAR(20),
    ticket_type VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Payments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    payment_method VARCHAR(50),
    transaction_id VARCHAR(255),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB)

### User Preferences Document
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("user_id"),
  "favorite_genres": ["rock", "pop"],
  "favorite_venues": ["venue_id1", "venue_id2"],
  "notification_preferences": {
    "email": true,
    "sms": false,
    "push": true
  },
  "search_history": [
    {
      "query": "Taylor Swift concert",
      "timestamp": ISODate("2024-03-15T10:30:00Z")
    }
  ]
}
```

### Event Reviews Document
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("event_id"),
  "reviews": [
    {
      "user_id": "user_id1",
      "rating": 4,
      "comment": "Great show!",
      "timestamp": ISODate("2024-03-16T09:00:00Z")
    }
  ],
  "average_rating": 4.5,
  "review_count": 100
}
```

### Inventory Management Document
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("event_id"),
  "total_seats": 1000,
  "available_seats": 500,
  "seat_map": {
    "A1": "available",
    "A2": "booked",
    "A3": "held"
  },
  "pricing_tiers": [
    {
      "name": "VIP",
      "price": 200.00,
      "available": 50
    },
    {
      "name": "General",
      "price": 100.00,
      "available": 450
    }
  ],
  "holds": [
    {
      "hold_id": "hold1",
      "seat": "B1",
      "expiration": ISODate("2024-03-15T11:00:00Z")
    }
  ]
}
```

## Considerations for Global Scale

1. **Sharding**: Implement sharding for the relational database tables, particularly for `events`, `bookings`, and `tickets`. Shard keys could be based on geographical location or event date.

2. **Caching**: Use a distributed cache like Redis to store frequently accessed data such as event details, available seats, and user sessions.

3. **Read Replicas**: Set up read replicas for the relational database to handle high read traffic, especially for event listings and searches.

4. **Geo-Distribution**: Distribute databases across multiple regions to reduce latency for users worldwide. Use multi-region replication for both relational and NoSQL databases.

5. **Time-Series Data**: For analytics and reporting, consider using a time-series database like InfluxDB to store metrics data.

6. **Event Streaming**: Implement an event streaming platform like Apache Kafka to handle real-time updates for inventory management and notifications.

7. **Elasticsearch**: Use Elasticsearch for full-text search functionality, indexing events, venues, and other searchable content.
